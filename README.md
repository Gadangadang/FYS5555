# Research based Particle Physics
This repo is for the University of Oslo course Research based Particle Physics (FYS5555) <br>
taught by Professor Farid Ould-Saada. It contains two smaller projects and one larger project. <br>
<br>
Project 1 aimes to compare analytical and numerical calculations for differential and total cross section <br>
for muon muon scattering, creating a bottom-anti bottom quark pair. <br>
<br>
Project 2 is undetermined <br>
Project 3 is undetermined <br>
