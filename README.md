### FYS5555
# Research based Particle Physics
This repo is for the University of Oslo course Research based Particle Physics (FYS5555) <br>
taught by Professor Farid Ould-Saada. It contains two smaller projects and one larger project. <br>
<br>
* Project 1 aimes to compare analytical and numerical calculations for differential and total cross section <br>
for muon muon scattering, creating a bottom-anti bottom quark pair. <br>

* Project 2 aimes to discuss the 4 lepton final state using Open Data from ATLAS. <br>
* Project 3 aimes to explore the use of semi unsupervised learning on ATLAS open data. <br>
<br>
To run the code, first install the requirements. This can be done calling this command:

```
pip install -r requirements

```
Note that to do the calculations in project 2 and 3, you need ROOT, and access to ATLAS Open data. The code in project 2, <br>
and project 3 has been run on a server at the Insitute of Physics @ UiO.
