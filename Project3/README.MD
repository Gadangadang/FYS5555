# Project 3
### Deployment of unsupervised learning for new physics at ATLAS with OPENDATA

This repository contains code and results for analyzing 2 lepton data from ATLAS <br>
Open Data. This project aims to understand how to use auto encoders for anomaly detection <br>
in high energy physics.


<br>
The folders are structured Ã­n the following way: <br>

<ol>
<li>Codebase contains notebooks with the machine learning and data handling</li>
<li>Article contains the report written for this project </li>
<li>figures contains the results from the different runs. Split into relevant folder for different tries </li>
<li>tf_models contains trained networks </li>
</ol>
