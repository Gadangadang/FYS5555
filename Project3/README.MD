# Project 3
### Deployment of unsupervised learning for new physics at ATLAS with OPENDATA

This repository contains code and results for analyzing 2 lepton data from ATLAS <br>
Open Data. This project aims to understand how to use auto encoders for anomaly detection <br>
in high energy physics.


<br>
The folders are structured Ã­n the following way: <br>
```
Codebase contains notebooks with the machine learning and data handling 
Article contains the report written for this project 
figures contains the results from the different runs. Split into relevant folder for different tries 
tf_models contains trained networks
