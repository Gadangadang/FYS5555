# Project 2
### Reconstruction of Higgs discovery using 4 lepton final state from ATLAS open data

This project used open data from ATLAS to attempt to discover the Higgs boson, <br> 
by looking at 4 lepton and two dilepton invariant mass histograms. We used ROOT in Jupyter Notebook <br>
and to run the data, one needs access to open data, as well as a few other files <br>
that are imported in the notebook.
