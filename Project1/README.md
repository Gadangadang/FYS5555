# Project 1 

This project will look at muon scattering into a bottom-anti bottom quark pair.<br >
Most of the tasks are calculations by hand found in the calculations pdf, <br >
with some numerical calculations, and with comparison from compHEP. <br>
<br>
The project folder has 4 folders: <br>
* Article holds the current version of the project report, as well as written notes for the analytical calculations, as well as the project tasks. 
* Codebase holds the code sheets used to do the calculations.
* Figures holds the plots created 
* datasets holds the datasets created from CompHEP used to compare with my analytical calculations.
